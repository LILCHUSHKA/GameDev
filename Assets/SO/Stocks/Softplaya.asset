    companyDescription: One of the oldest Russian independent developers of computer
      games. It was founded in 1968 by Konstantin Sokolov, who took the post of head
      of the company. In addition to developing its own games, the company is engaged
      in publishing games of other companies from various European countries. Since
      the company was founded, about 250 games have been developed and published,
      and the company's fortune has grown 18.4 times. Nevertheless, the capitalization
      of the company leaves much to be desired.
