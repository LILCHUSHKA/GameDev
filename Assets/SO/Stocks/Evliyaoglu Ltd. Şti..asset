    companyName: "Evliyaoglu Ltd. \u015Eti."
    companyDescription: A company specializing in the development and publication
      of computer games, whose main office is located in Limassol, Cyprus. It is
      one of the largest game publishers in Asia. At first, the company was focused
      on developing ported versions of games from other studios. But in 1983 she
      started developing her own games. In the history of the company, it has happened
      that the release of games was delayed due to the fact that developers, wanting
      to improve the quality of the game, continued to refine and test it. At the
      moment, it is the company with the largest office on the planet, which employs
      8,400 employees at the same time.
